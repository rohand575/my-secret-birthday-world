The way you smiled when you talked about your dreams, the sparkle in your eyes – I was captivated. That two-hour conversation felt like minutes, and I left knowing I wanted to spend every moment getting to know you better. ☕💕"

You fell asleep on my shoulder during the third movie, and I just sat there, afraid to move, wanting that peaceful moment to last forever. That's when I knew – every holiday, every moment, I want them all with you. 🎄❤️"
